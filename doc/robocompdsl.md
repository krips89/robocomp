#Using robocompdsl

**robocompdsl** is the new tool used in RoboComp to automatically generate components or modify their main properties once they have been generated (e.g., communication requirements, UI type). It is one of the core tools of the framework so, if you installed RoboComp, you can start using it right away.

This new version can only be used from the command line, but the languages used to define components and their interfaces remain the same: **CDSL** to specify components and **IDSL** to specify interfaces. Take a look to the tutorial ["a brief introduction to Components"](components.md) for an introduction to the concept of component generation and the languages involved.

There are two ways of using **robocompdsl**: to generate dummy CDSL files and to generate the code for a previous CDSL file.

## Generating a dummy CDSL file


## Generating a component given a CDSL file



## Updating a component given a CDSL file
